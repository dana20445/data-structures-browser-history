# data-structures-browser-history
## Project Overview
This project is a console-based application developed for the **Data Structures course**.
It simulates a simplified web browser navigation and bookmark management system using
**singly and doubly linked lists**.

## Concepts Used
- Singly Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- File Parsing
- Time & Date Handling
- Algorithm Complexity Considerations
- Stack
## Features
- Load browsing history and bookmarks from a text file
- Navigate and manage browser history
- Add and remove bookmarked pages
- Track visit count and last visited time
- Remove old browsing history
- Search browsing history by URL substring
- Identify most related and most visited pages
- Save data back to file without duplication
## Data Structures
- Doubly linked list for browsing history
- Doubly linked list for bookmarks
- Singly linked list for related pages
## Technologies
- Language: C++
- Paradigm: Procedural / Data-Structure-Oriented
## Input Format
The program parses a structured text file representing pages, related pages, and bookmarks.
## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
2. Make sure the input file is in the correct format
3. Run the executable and follow the menu instructions
